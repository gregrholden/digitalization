      | Every two years, the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) endeavors to 
      | make a big splash with their research via a large-scale project.
      | The first such project was called the #[em IRI2038 Futures Study], 
      | which took a deep look into the future of managing research and development (R&amp;D)
      | using futurist forecasting tools and techniques. The 
      | current project, which ends the week of October 16, 2016, is on 
      | the implications of the rising "Digital Era" on the function and 
      | management of R&amp;D.
      br
      br
      | This project received a kick start from a thought-provoking presentation
      | by Temple University's Dr. Youngjin Yoo who spoke at the 2014 IRI 
      | Member Summit in Denver, Colorado.
      br
      br
      | Following Dr. Yoo's presentation, discussions began on how to incorporate
      | his ideas into a research project. IRI's next big thing, the 
      | Digitalization Project, as it became known, got its official start
      | shortly thereafter, in early 2015.

      h3 The Digitalization Research Platform
      br
      | This project consists of R&amp;D managers and executives from large,
      | product development companies coming together at IRI events, and
      | virtually, to collaborate on how digitalization affects their 
      | respective industries. The project is broken into three groups: 
      | Big Data, Collaboration, and Virtual Experimentation &amp; Simulation, 
      | or VE&amp;S.
      br
      br
      | The Digitalization Project will culminate at the 
      | 2016 Member Summit in Chicago, Illinois, where all three project 
      | teams will be presenting their findings. It is the intention of 
      | this project to provide a comprehensive guide for maximizing the 
      | benefits of digitalization on innovation while avoiding 
      | common pitfalls. As with all IRI research, this project will be done by 
      | practitioners, for practitioners, with a focus on tangible 
      | take-aways that can be implemented in the near term.

              | Big Data is an oft-touted term that has no commonly agreed-upon 
              | definition despite its prevalent use.
              | The overall purpose of this group is to look at how Big Data, defined
              | as "uncomfortable data", can inform,
              | empower, and/or disrupt R&amp;D organizations based on how they

              | Considering the ubiquitousness of internet connectivity and smart 
              | devices, instantaneous communication and collaboration has become 
              | commonplace. The pace of development of tools that enable 
              | real-time collaboration from anywhere has also witnessed 
              | an explosion recently. How can R&amp;D organizations 
              | navigate the landscape of these tools to the best effect?

              | Any physical experiment necessarily 
              | includes a set of data that is not quantifiable; results from each iteration carry 
              | intuition that researchers develop throughout their careers based
              | on the expectations of how real world conditions affect their experiments. However, 
              | twenty-first century research requires much more use of virtual 
              | laboratories and simulation software 
              | that mimic real world conditions. How do we gain trust in such 
              | simulations knowing that they may not capture conditions perfectly?
